## Research Insights

### No Universal Solution
Different railway route types benefit from different communication approaches:
- **Urban routes** → Cellular communication optimal
- **Remote routes** → Satellite communication necessary  
- **Depot operations** → LoRa provides zero operational costs
- **Mixed operations** → Modular approach enables optimization

### Power Consumption Critical
ESP32's efficient power consumption (130mA @ 5V with enhanced UI vs 150mA Pi idle) enables:
- 38-hour battery backup with enhanced UI active, 60+ hours with auto-off
- Compact 10Ah battery system sufficient for requirements
- Reduced charging system complexity
- Reliable operation during locomotive power outages

### Modular Architecture Advantages
The modular approach transforms traditional trade-offs into unified benefits:
- **Cost vs Coverage** → Route-optimized modules provide both
- **Simplicity vs Flexibility** → Standardized platform with configurable modules
- **Present vs Future** → Hot-swappable modules support technology evolution
