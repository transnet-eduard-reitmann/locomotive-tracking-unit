---

## 9. Hybrid Deployment Strategy

### 9.1 Selective Satellite Deployment

**Recommended Approach:**

- **75% of fleet** with LoRa (depot and urban operations)

**Cost Optimization:**
```
5 units √ó Swarm:     R24K hardware + R5K/year = R49K (5 years)
20 units √ó Cellular: R57K hardware + R60K/year = R357K (5 years)
75 units √ó LoRa:     R116K hardware + R5K/year = R141K (5 years)
TOTAL:               R547K (5 years) vs R937K all-cellular
```

### 9.2 Route-Based Assignment

| Route Type | Primary Tech | Backup | Rationale |
|------------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **Sishen-Saldanha** | Satellite | None needed | Remote desert |
| **Cross-border** | Satellite | Cellular | International roaming |
| **Coal routes** | Cellular | LoRa | Good coverage |
| **Urban freight** | LoRa | Cellular | Cost optimization |
| **Passenger** | Cellular | None | Customer info needs |

## 11. Recommendations

### 11.1 Feasibility Assessment

**Satellite-only IS feasible for SA railways IF:**
- Remote route coverage justifies premium costs
- Budget allows R10-50/unit/day for communications
- Latency of hours is acceptable for operations
- International operations are significant

**Satellite-only is NOT recommended IF:**
- Primary routes have cellular coverage
- Budget constraints are significant
- Real-time operations are required
- Local-only operations

### 11.2 Recommended Approach

**Best Practice Hybrid:**
1. **Conduct limited pilot** with 5 Swarm units on Iron Ore line
2. **Validate coverage and latency** over 3-month period
3. **Use satellite as backup** for critical locomotives
4. **Primary tracking** via cellular/LoRa where available
5. **Reserve satellite** for true remote/emergency use

### 11.3 Vendor Selection

**For South African Railways:**
- **Wait for Swarm approval** if cost is primary driver
- **Choose Iridium 9603** for immediate deployment
- **Consider Certus 9704** only for premium applications
- **Avoid commitment** until pilot validates use case

## Conclusion

Satellite-only locomotive tracking represents a **premium solution for guaranteed global coverage** but comes with significant cost and latency trade-offs. While technically feasible, it is **not economically optimal** for South African railway operations where cellular and LoRa alternatives exist.

**Key Findings:**
- **Cost prohibitive** for full fleet deployment (10x cellular costs)
- **High latency** incompatible with real-time operations
- **Regulatory hurdles** with Swarm in South Africa
- **Excellent backup** option for critical assets
- **Ideal for remote routes** like Iron Ore line

**Final Recommendation:**
Deploy satellite selectively (5-10 units) on the most remote routes or highest-value assets as a **premium tracking solution**, while using cellular/LoRa for the majority of the fleet. This hybrid approach balances coverage, cost, and operational requirements effectively.

**Investment Summary (Selective Deployment - 10 Units):**
- **Initial (Swarm):** R48,000 hardware
- **Annual Operating:** R10,000
- **5-Year Total:** R98,000
- **Per Unit Per Month:** R163

This selective approach provides satellite capability where truly needed while maintaining reasonable overall system costs.
